    <p style="font-size: 26; text-align: justify;">    Programming language, in computer science, artificial language used to write a sequence of instructions (a computer program) than can be run by a computer. Similar to natural languages, such as English, programming languages have a vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. However, natural languages are not studied for programming computers because they are ambiguous, meaning that their vocabulary and grammatical structure may be interpreted in multiple ways. The languages used to program computers must have simple logical structures.<br>
   Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century. Programming language can be classified as either low-level languages or high-level languages. Low-level programming languages or machine languages are the most basic type of programming languages differ depending on the manufacturer and model of computer. High-level languages are programming languages that must first be translated into a machine language before they can be understood and processed by a computer. Examples are C , C++, PASCAL and Fortran. Assembly languages are intermediate languages that are very close to machine language and do not have the level of linguistic sophistication exhibited by other high high-level languages but must still be translated into machine language.

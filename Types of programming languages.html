    <p style="font-size: 26; text-align: justify;">
    <b>Fortran: </b> the first important algorithmic language was Fortran designed in 1957 by an IBM team led by. It was intended for scientific computations with real numbers and collections of them organized as one-or multidimensional arrays. Its control structures included conditional if statements, repetitive loops and a GOTO statement that allowed no sequential execution of program code. FORTRAN made it convenient to have subprograms for common mathematical operations, and built libraries of them.<br>

    <b>C: </b>the C programming language was developed in 1972. Its capacity to structure data and programs through the composition of smaller units is comparable to that of ALGOL. It uses a compact notation and provides the programmer with the ability to operate with the addresses of data as well as with their values. This ability is important in systems programming and C shares with assembly language the power to exploit all the features of a computer's internal architecture. C, along with its descendant C++, remains one of the most common languages.<br>
    <b>JAVA: </b> is a high level, object-oriented, general purpose programming language with many features that make it suitable for communications, fianc√©, hospitality, health science.<br>
    <b>Python :</b>is an interpreted, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces that cost of program maintenance.
